players decided to form a club in order to continue playing
the sport in the manner in which they were accustomed back
home, especially the well-known after the match social
aspects.</p><p>Over the next few years things developed rapidly. In 1970,
the Second XV was born, by 1972 the Belgian National side
had been beaten and the Belgian Cup won. In 1973, the Third
XV was launched and with a steadily improving fixture list
we were playing with credit such sides as Coventry,
Blackheath, Newbridge and Public School Wanderers. In 1974
the Belgian Cup was won again. This halcyon period continued
unabated through to the club's very successful tour of the
USA in May 1978, when we played seven matches and the First
XV remained unbeaten against the best sides on the East
Coast.</p><p>Since 1978 the club has continued to remain one of the most
active and successful expatriate clubs in Europe. During
this latter period the standard of Belgian Rugby and the
number of clubs has increased significantly. In 1982 we won
the Belgian Cup for the third time and finished off with a
successful tour to Canada. In 1980 we entered the Belgian
League division Five. During the following years we worked
our way through the divisions gaining promotion in
successive seasons and took the championship of the Premier
Division at our first attempt in 1985. At the end of that
season we celebrated with our third major tour, this time to
Colorado, USA. Whilst since then we have failed to emanate
winning the championship, we have had successful tours to
USA (Boston), Spain (thrice), Czechoslovakia (twice),
Ireland, Estonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal.</p><p>The club has also organised International Charity Rugby
Matches in 1986-87-90-91 which brought to Belgium many of
the most famous Rugby players of the 1970s and early 1980's
from the Five Nations to play against a Belgian Select side,
which at the same time raised over â‚¬60,000 for various
deserving charities.</p><p>Whilst the majority of players traditionally came from Great
Britain and Ireland, there have nearly always been members
from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, USA plus other
neighbouring European countries. In the 1980s we had all
three of the Western Samoan's Ambassador's sons playing for
us, the oldest Vince Fepuleia going on to play for Western
Samoa against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park in 1988. Several
times we have fielded a first XV with players from 11
different countries, probably a world record! In our 45
years history we have had members from over 47 different
countries. In 2000 we changed the name from "British" to
"Barbarians", remaining BBRFC, thus reflecting the wide
membership base, but still staying an English speaking club
welcoming players of any nationality, and always having a
few Belgian players in our membership. Indeed we are very
proud that one of our Belgian members and a former player,
Freddy Thielemans, was, until recently, the long-serving
Mayor of Brussels.</p><p>Since 1995 we have also successfully run a Ladies XV,
becoming Belgian Champions in 2006. Since 2005 we have also
been an international partner club of English Premiership
side Saracens FC.</p><p>In May 2008 we had the honour of hosting a training session
and dinner for The "Barbarian FC" in advance of their match
against Belgium. One of our members Mat Hocken, a former
Cambridge Blue and New Zealand U-21 player was part of that
Belgian team, and subsequently in November that year was
invited to play for the Barbarians in their annual fixture
against the United Services in Plymouth, England.</p><p>With the advent of the recessionary times of those past
years the playing strength of the club took a bit of a hit,
a reflection that companies employed less expats than in
former times. Hence the team was left out with only one
senior mens team and one ladies team, with the mens team
playing in the Flemish Regional League (fourth level of
Belgian Rugby). The aim was therefore to return to the
national leagues and turn out a regular second team.</p><p>Further our symbol, the Manneken-Pis with a Rugby ball under
his arm is a unique and now famous emblem amongst world
Rugby clubs. We hope in our own special way that BBRFC has
helped raise the standard of Belgian Rugby over the years,
plus publicising the game both here and abroad.</p><p>Indeed we are confidently look forward to celebrating the
club's 50th anniversary in 2018 in style both on and of the
pitch.</p></div></div></div><div class="container-third"><div class="container"><div class="row"><header class="major"><h2>Proudly sponsored by</h2></header><div class="hidden-xs"><a href="http://humebrophy.com/" target="_blank"><div class="sponsors sponsors-humebrophy"></div></a><a href="http://vgc.be/" target="_blank"><div class="sponsors sponsors-vgc"></div></a><a href="http://be.brussels/brussels" target="_blank"><div class="sponsors sponsors-brc"></div></a><a href="http://rugby.vlaanderen" target="_blank"><div class="sponsors sponsors-vlaams"></div></a><a href="http://www.fbrb.be" target="_blank"><div class="sponsors sponsors-fbrb"></div></a></div><div class="visible-xs col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2"><ul class="list-group"><li class="list-group-item active">Our sponsors</li><li class="list-group-item"><a href="http://humebrophy.com/" target="_blank">Hume Brophy</a></li><li class="list-group-item"><a href="http://vgc.be/" target="_blank">Vlaamse Gemeenschap Comissie</a></li><li class="list-group-item"><a href="http://be.brussels/brussels" target="_blank">Region Capitale</a></li><li class="list-group-item"><a href="http://rugby.vlaanderen" target="_blank">Rugby Vlaanderen</a></li><li class="list-group-item"><a href="http://www.fbrb.be" target="_blank">FBRB</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-xs-12"><p>If you would like to be part of our sponsoring team, please <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a></p></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><header class="major"><h2>Connect with us</h2><p class="lead">There are more ways to connect with BBRFC Celtic!</p></header><!--External links--><div class="row icons"><div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-offset-2"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBRFCCeltic" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></a></div><div class="col-xs-2"><a href="https://twitter.com/rugbybrussels" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></div><div class="col-xs-2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzkwTofC83CNCw3Bl105Tw/videos" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a></div><div class="col-xs-2"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/BBRFC-Celtic-3695085/about" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></div></div></div></div><hr /><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-4"><p class="info-title">Ruck 'n Maul:</p><p>Triomflaan 52, 1160 Auderghem</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p class="info-title">Pitch:</p><p>Triomflaan 40 (VUB entrance 8), 1150 Elsene</p></div><div class="col-sm-4"><p class="info-title">Contact:</p><a href="mailto:info@bbrfc-celtic.be"> info@bbrfc-celtic.be</a></div></div></div><div id="rule"></div><div class="footy"><i class="fa fa-lg fa-code"></i><span> on </span><a href="https://github.com/bbrfc-celtic/website-dev"><i class="fa fa-github"></i>GitHub</a></div></footer></body></html>
