No player
is <strong>to play or be registered</strong> until the fee has
been paid. The latter is considered outstanding if not settled
by the end of September or 30 days after having joined. After
that, a &euro;10 increase will be applied.</p><p>Payment plans are always an option, so please contact <a href="mailto:treasurer@bbrfc-celtic.be">our treasurer</a> if you would like one.</p><p>VUB students who wish to only train with us can do so for
free, without filling in any forms, provided they are insured
by the VUB. To play matches, the normal procedure applies.</p></div></div>
